      <h1>My Journey of Change</h1>
           <p>I was just like many teenagers during my high school years, caught up in gaming and vices that I thought were harmless at the time. I often struggled with anger issues, not knowing where they came from or how to control them. Those years were tough—I was lost in my own frustration and bad habits.</p>
      
           <p>When I reached my second year in college, I realized I needed to change. I made the decision to leave my vices behind and focus on becoming a better version of myself. It wasn’t easy. I had to confront the pain I carried from my past and begin healing my inner child. I started working on understanding myself, learning to control my emotions, and finding peace within.</p>
      
           <p>To support myself, I took on jobs. I worked in construction at Mayer Steelpipe Corporation and later at FETA Mediterranean. These experiences taught me resilience and discipline. Now, as a Foodpanda rider, I juggle work and being a third-year BSIT student.</p>
      <p>Life is still a challenge, but I’m proud of how far I’ve come. I’m no longer defined by my past but by my determination to grow, heal, and succeed. My journey isn’t perfect, but every step forward is proof that I’m capable of change.</p>
